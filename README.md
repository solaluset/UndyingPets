## Installation
1. Download this datapack from releases tab
2. Put it into `datapacks` folder in your world save

## How does it work?
It gives totems of undying to every tamed mob.
When the mob "dies" (totem is consumed), it will freeze and a label saying "DEAD" will appear.
You need to bring the dead mob back to full health for it to resurrect (usually by feeding or with health potions, except for wolves).

### What about wolves?
It's not possible to use usual resurrection mechanic for wolves because of [this bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-193202).
To resurrect wolves, you need to throw them any acceptable kind of meat.

## Incompatibilities
This datapack is incompatible and may conflict with any datapack or mod that uses offhand slots of tamed mobs.
Note that ANY mob that has `Owner` tag will become unkillable, even if it's not actually a pet.
